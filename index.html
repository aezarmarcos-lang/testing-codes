        <tr>
            <td>Chlamydia</td>
            <td>
                A very common STI that often shows no symptoms. It spreads through vaginal or anal intercourse.
                It is treatable with antibiotics but can lead to infertility and Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID),
                especially in women.
            </td>
            <td>Trichomoniasis</td>
            <td>
                A treatable infection caused by the parasite <em>Trichomonas vaginalis</em>. It is transmitted
                through sexual contact and may cause strong-smelling discharge, itching, and painful urination.
            </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Gonorrhea</td>
            <td>
                A bacterial infection that can affect the rectum, throat, or eyes. It is transmitted through
                sexual contact with infected fluids and may be asymptomatic. Antibiotics are required to prevent
                complications such as infertility or PID.
            </td>
            <td>Scabies</td>
            <td>
                A skin condition caused by mites that spread through prolonged skin-to-skin contact, including
                sexual contact. It causes intense itching, rashes, and visible burrows on the skin.
            </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Syphilis</td>
            <td>
                Caused by the bacterium <em>Treponema pallidum</em>. It spreads through sexual contact and progresses
                in stages. It can affect many organs and is known as the “Great Imitator” due to varied symptoms.
                It is treatable with antibiotics.
            </td>
            <td>Pubic Lice (Crabs)</td>
            <td>
                Small parasites that infest coarse body hair, especially in the pubic area. They feed on human
                blood and cause intense itching.
            </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus)</td>
            <td>
                A virus that attacks the immune system. If untreated, it can lead to AIDS. It is transmitted
                through unprotected sexual contact and exposure to infected blood or bodily fluids.
            </td>
            <td>Amebiasis and Giardiasis</td>
            <td>
                Intestinal infections caused by protozoan parasites. They can spread through oral-anal or
                oral-genital contact and are more common among certain populations.
